# crust_formulizer

crust_formulizer is a Rust program that converts a Yaml file of a baking formula and outputs a csv. This program makes it easy to quickly analyze an arbitrarily complex dough formula, and make updates to the formula using the resulting csv. Making a spreadsheet by hand for each dough formula is tedious. For now, the program is a CLI application. Eventually, crust_formulizer will have a GUI that makes producing a dough formula spreadsheet easy for any baker.
